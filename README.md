# Bagel
The implementation of 'Robust and Unsupervised KPI Anomaly Detection Based on Conditional Variational Autoencoder'
Models are in `model.py`.

**The module `threshold_selection` is missed. You can replace it with a self-defined threshold.**

# Dependencies
python >= 3.7

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Torch requires a manual download (make sure it's version 0.4)


# Run
``` bash
python main.py
```
For the sample code

``` bash
python competition.py
```
For the comp code
